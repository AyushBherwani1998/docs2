# Welcome

:::caution Berkeley Mainnet release has landed

Please make sure to upgrade your mina nodes to **3.0.0** ([Release notes](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/releases/tag/3.0.0))  
[See instructions on how to upgrade your Mina node](/node-operators/requirements)

**Note**:  
Non-seed nodes will remain in `Bootstrap` status until such a point as block production begins at **`00:00UTC on June 5th`**. During this period of no block production, nodes will automatically **terminate after 25 minutes**, this is **expected behavior**.  
Please ensure you have configured your nodes to [auto-restart](/node-operators/requirements#node-auto-restart) on crash to have them automatically try and reconnect.
