# Custom Tokens

Blockchain applications have various use cases for custom tokens, including a real-world financial asset, stake in an on-chain protocol, or even skill points in a game.

Most blockchains, like Ethereum, do not natively support custom tokens. You implement custom tokens as smart contracts on top of the execution layer of the underlying protocol.
Token standards ensure the interoperability of applications on Etherum, these standardisations are agree upon in ERCs, Ethereum Request for customElements, such as the fungible token standard [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).
The Ethereum community has created and agreed upon other reference implementations and standardisation that are audited and easy to configure, such as [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) for NFTs. 

Mina supports custom token functionality at a low level in the tech stack. Mina treats custom tokens almost the same way as the native MINA token. This approach offers the following benefits:

- As a developer, you do not have to manage as many boilerplate contracts.
- Developers don't need to keep track of accounts and balances themselves.
- It is more secure because fewer vulnerabilities can result from incorrect configuration and deployment.
- Interacting with custom tokens is more efficient: End users experience lower transaction fees because of less computation at the execution layer. 

Each account on Mina can have tokens associated with it. With zkApps, you build smart contracts that interact with tokens, such as swapping one token for another or depositing MINA tokens. A token manager smart contract is a standard smart contract with the `TokenContract` class that manipulates tokens. 

## Token manager account

The token manager account can set a token symbol (also called token name) for its token. For example, `MYTKN`. Uniqueness is not enforced for token names because the public key of the manager account is used to identify tokens.

A token manager smart contract sets the rules around minting, burning, and sending the custom token:

- Minting generates new tokens. The zkApp updates an account's balance by adding the newly created tokens to it. You can send minted tokens to any existing account in the network.
- Burning tokens is the opposite of minting. Burning tokens deducts the balance of a certain address by the specified amount. A zkApp cannot burn more tokens than the specified account has.
- Sending tokens between two accounts must be approved by a zkApp.

## TokenContract class

Use the `TokenContract` class to perform common token operations, such as minting, burning, and sending tokens. In o1js, the `TokenContract` class is your blueprint for custom token implementations. 

As shown in this [example code](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/src/lib/mina/token/token-contract.unit-test.ts#L13), you inherit from the `TokenContract` class:

```ts
class ExampleTokenContract extends TokenContract {
```

### How to mint tokens

To mint the entire supply to the token account with the same address as the smart contract:

```ts
this.internal.mint({ address: this.address, amount: this.SUPPLY });
```

### How to burn tokens

To burn the specified amount of tokens for the sender:

```ts
this.internal.burn({ address: sender, amount});
```

## How to transfer tokens

This example code demonstrates how to transfer tokens between two accounts:

```ts
let transferTx = await Mina.transaction(sender, () => {
  AccountUpdate.fundNewAccount(sender);
  token.transfer(tokenAddress, otherAddress, UInt64.one);
});
```

Many use cases exist for transferring tokens, like calling a DEX contract's `swap()` method that authorizes the spending of a `Y` token and then calls `tokenY.transfer()` with `dexY.self` as the sender. The receiver is an EOA specified by an address as usual.

## Custom Token Terminology

If your zkApp interacts with custom tokens, here are the essential terms.

### Token id

Token ids are unique identifiers that distinguish between different types of custom tokens. Custom token identifiers are globally unique across the entire network.

Token ids are derived from a zkApp. To check the token id of a zkApp, use the `this.token.id` property.

### Token Accounts

Token accounts are like regular accounts, but they hold a balance of a specific custom token instead of MINA. A token account is created from an existing account and is specified by a public key _and_ a token id. 

Token accounts are specific for each type of custom token, so a single public key can have many different token accounts.

A token account is automatically created for a public key whenever an existing account receives a transaction denoted with a custom token. 

When a token account is created for the first time, an account creation fee must be paid the same as creating a new standard account.

In addition to sending custom tokens, a **token owner account** can mint and burn custom tokens. A token owner account is the governing zkApp account for a specific custom token.

### Token Owner

A token owner is an zkApp account that creates, facilitates, and governs how a custom token can be used. The token owner is the account that created the custom token and is the only account that can:

- Mint tokens
- Burn tokens
- Approve sending tokens between two accounts

If two accounts want to send tokens to each other, the token owner must approve the transaction. The token owner generates the changes the two accounts want to make and can then make assertions about those changes. The token owner can approve the transaction with a proof.
