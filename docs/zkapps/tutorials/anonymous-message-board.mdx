# Anonymous Message Board Tutorial

[How to write a zkApp](/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp) provides a high-level overview of everything you need to know to build applications on Mina. 

Now, you can see how to put these ideas into practice as you walk through designing and implementing of a semi-anonymous messaging protocol.

In this tutorial, you build a smart contract that allows users to publish messages semi-anonymously. 
- The contract will allow a specific set of users to create new messages but will not disclose which user within the set has done so. 
- This way, people can leverage one aspect of their identity without revealing exactly who they are. 

An example use case for this semi-anonymous contract is to enable a DAO member to make credible statements on behalf of their DAO without revealing their specific individual identity.

## Prerequisites

Ensure your environment meets the [Prerequisites](/zkapps/tutorials#prerequisites) for zkApp Developer Tutorials.

In particular, make sure you have the zkApp CLI installed:

```sh
$ npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

This tutorial has been tested with:

- [zkApp CLI](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli) version 0.13.0
- [o1js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/o1js) version 0.13.1

## Create the message-board project

1. Create or change to a directory where you have write privileges.
1. Create the project:

  ```sh
  $ zk project message-board
  ```

  The `zk project` command can scaffold the UI for your project. For this tutorial, select `none`.

This command creates a directory with a new project template that is fully set up and ready for local development.

### Prepare the project

Example smart contract files come with the new project, you can delete them if you want.  

1. Optional: Delete the example files not used in this tutorial:

  ```sh
  $ rm src/Add.ts
  $ rm src/Add.test.ts
  ```

Now that your project is set up, you can open it in your IDE or `cd message-board` if you work from the command line.

1. To create the `src/message.ts` file and generate the corresponding `src/message.test.ts` test file:

  ```sh
  $ zk file message
  ```

1. Download the `message.ts` file from the examples repository. 

  This tutorial walks you through the `Message` smart contract code already completed in the `src/Square.ts` example file.  

### Copy the example 

This tutorial describes each part of the completed code in the [Square.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/blob/main/examples/zkapps/01-hello-world/src/Square.ts) example file. 

1. First, open the [Square.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/blob/main/examples/zkapps/01-hello-world/src/Square.ts) example file.

1. Copy the entire contents of the file into your smart contract in the `src/Square.ts` file.

Now you are ready to review the imports in the smart contract. 

1. Review the following:

  ```ts
  import {
    Field,
    SmartContract,
    state,
    State,
    method,
    DeployArgs,
    Permissions,
    PrivateKey,
    PublicKey,
    isReady,
    Poseidon,
    Encoding,
  } from 'o1js';

  export { isReady, Field, Encoding };

  // Wait till our o1js instance is ready
  await isReady;

  // These private keys are exported so that experimenting with the contract is
  // easy. Three of them (the Bobs) are used when the contract is deployed to
  // generate the public keys that are allowed to post new messages. Jack's key
  // is never added to the contract. So he won't be able to add new messages. In
  // real life, we would only use the Bobs' public keys to configure the contract,
  // and only they would know their private keys.

  export const users = {
    Bob: PrivateKey.fromBase58(
      'EKFAdBGSSXrBbaCVqy4YjwWHoGEnsqYRQTqz227Eb5bzMx2bWu3F'
    ),
    SuperBob: PrivateKey.fromBase58(
      'EKEitxmNYYMCyumtKr8xi1yPpY3Bq6RZTEQsozu2gGf44cNxowmg'
    ),
    MegaBob: PrivateKey.fromBase58(
      'EKE9qUDcfqf6Gx9z6CNuuDYPe4XQQPzFBCfduck2X4PeFQJkhXtt'
    ), // This one says duck in it :)
    Jack: PrivateKey.fromBase58(
      'EKFS9v8wxyrrEGfec4HXycCC2nH7xf79PtQorLXXsut9WUrav4Nw'
    ),
  };

  export class Add extends SmartContract {
    // On-chain state definitions

    @method init() {
      // Define initial values of on-chain state
    }

    @method publishMessage(message: Field, signerPrivateKey: PrivateKey) {
      // Compute signerPublicKey from signerPrivateKey argument
      // Get approved public keys
      // Assert that signerPublicKey is one of the approved public keys
      // Update on-chain message variable
      // Computer new messageHistoryHash
      // Update on-chain messageHistoryHash
    }
  }
  ```

This code serves as the scaffolding for the rest of the tutorial and contains a smart contract called `message` with two methods: 

- `init()` - Similar to the `constructor` in Solidity, it's where you define any set up that needs to happen before users begin interacting with the contract. 
- `publishMessage()` - The method that users invoke when they want to create a new message. 

  The `@method` decorator tells o1js to:

  - Allow users to call this method
  - Generate a zero-knowledge proof of its execution

### Define on-chain state

Every Mina smart contract includes eight on-chain state variables that each store almost 256 bits of information. In more complex smart contracts, these state variables can store commitments to off-chain storage (for example, commitments for the hash of a file, the root of a Merkle tree, and so on). 

For simplicity, this tutorial stores everything on-chain.

:::note
General purpose off-chain storage libraries are appropriate only for development. See [Tutorial 6: Off-Chain Storage](/zkapps/tutorials/offchain-storage).
:::

In this smart contract, one state variable stores the last message. Another stores the hash of all the previous messages so a frontend can validate message history. Three more state variables can store user public keys. It's possible to store additional public keys by Merkelizing them, but for this tutorial uses three for simplicity.

```ts
export class Add extends SmartContract {
  // On-chain state definitions
  @state(Field) message = State<Field>();
  @state(Field) messageHistoryHash = State<Field>();
  @state(PublicKey) user1 = State<PublicKey>();
  @state(PublicKey) user2 = State<PublicKey>();
  @state(PublicKey) user3 = State<PublicKey>();
```

The `@state(Field)` decorator tells o1js that the variable is stored on-chain as a `Field` type.

For practical purposes, the `Field` type is similar to the `uint256` type in Solidity. It can store large integers, and addition, subtraction, and multiplication all work as expected. The only caveats are division and what happens in the event of an overflow. To learn more about finite fields, see [Finite field arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic). It is not required to understand exactly how field arithmetic works for this tutorial. 

o1js also provides `UInt32`, `UInt64`, and `Int64` types. All o1js types are composed of the `Field` type, including `PublicKey` as shown in the previous example.

### Define the `init()` method

The `init` method is similar to the `constructor` in Solidity. It's where you define any setup that needs to happen before users begin interacting with the contract. In this case, set the public keys of users who can post and initialize `message` and `messageHistoryHash` as zero. The front end interprets the zero value to mean that no messages have been posted yet.

```ts
@method init() {
  // Define initial values of on-chain state
  this.user1.set(users['Bob'].toPublicKey());
  this.user2.set(users['SuperBob'].toPublicKey());
  this.user3.set(users['MegaBob'].toPublicKey());
  this.message.set(Field(0));
  this.messageHistoryHash.set(Field(0));
}
```

### Define `publishMessage()`

The `publishMessage` method allows an approved user to publish a message. The `@method` decorator makes this method callable by users so that they can interact with the smart contract.

For this example, pass in `message` and `signerPrivateKey` arguments to check that the user holds a private key associated with one of the three on-chain public keys before allowing them to update the message:

```ts
  @method publishMessage(message: Field, signerPrivateKey: PrivateKey) {
    // Compute signerPublicKey from signerPrivateKey argument
    // Get approved public keys
    // Assert that signerPublicKey is one of the approved public keys
    // Update on-chain message state
    // Computer new messageHistoryHash
    // Update on-chain messageHistoryHash
  }
```

Note that all inputs are private by default and exist only on the user's local machine when the smart contract runs. The Mina network never sees private inputs. 

The smart contract sends only values that are stored as state to the Mina blockchain. This means that even though the value of the `message` argument is eventually public, the value of `signerPrivateKey` never leaves the user's machine as a result of interacting with the smart contract.

### Compute `signerPublicKey` from `signerPrivateKey`

Now that you have the user's private key, you need to derive the associated public key to check it against the list of approved publishers. Luckily, the `PrivateKey` type in o1js includes a `toPublicKey()` method:

```ts
// Compute signerPublicKey from signerPrivateKey argument
const signerPublicKey = signerPrivateKey.toPublicKey();
```

To check if this public key matches one of the keys stored on-chain:.

```ts
// Get approved public keys
const user1 = this.user1.get();
const user2 = this.user2.get();
const user3 = this.user3.get();
```

Calling the `get()` method tells o1js to retrieve these values from the zkApp account on-chain state. 

:::note
o1js uses a single network request to retrieve all on-chain state values simultaneously.
:::

Finally, check if `signerPublicKey` is equal to one of the allowed public keys contained in the `user` variables:

```ts
// Assert that signerPublicKey is one of the approved public keys
signerPublicKey
  .equals(user1)
  .or(signerPublicKey.equals(user2))
  .or(signerPublicKey.equals(user3))
  .assertEquals(true);
```

Notice that you call the o1js `equals()` and `or()` methods instead of using the JavaScript operators (`===`, and `||`). The built-in o1js methods have the same effect, but they work with o1js types, and their execution can be verified using a zero-knowledge proof.

`assertEquals(true)` at the end means that it is impossible to generate a valid proof unless `signerPublicKey` is equal to one of the pre-approved users. The Mina network rejects any transaction sent to a zkApp account that doesn't include a valid zero-knowledge proof for that account. So it is impossible for users to post new messages unless they have a private key associated with one of the three pre-approved public keys.

### Update `message`

Up to this point, you have worked to ensure that only approved users can call `publishMessage()`. When they do, the contract updates the on-chain `message` variable to their new message:

```ts
// Update on-chain message state
this.message.set(message);
```

The `set()` method asks the Mina nodes to update the value of their on-chain state, but only if the associated proof is valid.

### Update `messageHistoryHash`

There's one more thing to do. If you want users to be able to keep track of what has been said, then you need to store a commitment to the message history on-chain. 

There are a few ways to do this, but the simplest is to store a hash of your new `message` and your old `messageHistoryHash` every time you call `publishMessage`:

```ts
// Compute new messageHistoryHash
const oldHash = this.messageHistoryHash.get();
const newHash = Poseidon.hash([message, oldHash]);

// Update on-chain state
this.messageHistoryHash.set(newHash);
```

That's it! Save the file. Now, to make sure everything compiles:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

If everything is correct, you see a new `./build` directory where the compiled version of your project lives that you can import into a user interface.

<!--

## Integrating with a User Interface (Coming Soon)

One of the benefits of writing smart contracts in TypeScript, is that the compiled JavaScript and WASM smart contract is easy to [integrate into your website UI](./zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp-ui).

We won’t make you write a UI for this tutorial, but we have created a simple command-line interface so you can interact with your smart contract as a user to get a sense of how it works, and experiment with what you have just built. You can clone it from [this](https://github.com/) repository.

```sh
git clone https://placeholder.com
cd ./placeholder
```

Now install your smart contract:

```sh
npm install ../zk-message
```

And start the front end:

```sh
npm run start

Who are you? (Bob, SuperBob, MegaBob, Jack): Bob

What would you like to say? (should only work if you are one of the Bobs): Snarky is a nice sharky.

Message history:
Snarky is a nice sharky.

Who are you? (Bob, SuperBob, MegaBob, Jack): Jack

What would you like to say? (should only work if you are one of the Bobs): Hello World!

** GNARLY ERROR **
```

## Wrapping up

This tutorial gives you a sense of what's possible with o1js. 

The messaging protocol you built is quite simple but also very powerful. You can use this basic pattern to create a whistleblower system, an anonymous NFT project, or even anonymous DAO voting. 

The main point is that o1js makes it easy for you to build things that don't intuitively seem possible.

Zero knowledge proofs open the door to an entirely different way of thinking about the internet.

We are excited to see what people like you will build.

## Keep going 

The logical next steps to extend this project include:

- Allow users to pass signers into the `publishMessage()` method directly so that many different organizations can use a single contract. 
  Hint: You'll have to store a commitment to the signers on-chain.
- Allow users to pass an arbitrarily large number of signers into the `publishMessage()` method.
- Store the message history in a Merkle tree so a user interface can quickly check a subset of the messages without evaluating the entire history.
- Build a shiny front end!
